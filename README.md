# Overview
The PiBell is a contactless doorbell system designed to help limit contact with rarely sanitized surfaces, such as doorbells, during the Covid-19 pandemic. PiBell allows a user to ring the doorbell with just a simple hand wave. After the hand wave is detected, if enabled, the PiBell will send a notification to a client android app along with a picture of the event. The PiBell comes with all of the essential features of other smart doorbells, such as a live view, and a whole host of customizations that the user can make. PiBell connects to a Raspberry Pi over the local network to provide all of this functionality to the user
